# Integration
Task – Integration with external party
You are given a CSV file – this is the input from an external system
Create a SQL Server database with only one table – Employees. That table should have as many columns as needed to accommodate data from the file.
Create a simple ASP.Net MVC website with one page. That page should contain 
Browse File control
a button to execute the import 
a grid/table (described below).
When the user selects the file and clicks on the Import button, the program should parse it, get data and insert it into the database. The page should report on how many rows were successfully processed.
The added rows should be shown in the grid on the same page. Data should be sorted by surname ascending. The grid should support sorting, searching, and editing functionality.
You are advised to use a third-party library for the grid.


The application should be considered as a real-world product. Make sure to comment and unit-test your code.
